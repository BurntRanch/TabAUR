# Predefined Themes for TabAUR

TabAUR was designed to support as much customizability as you wish! You can use themes, configure specific parts of how it behaves, etc.

This is a directory containing themes that you can setup in no time!

## Themes

File names should be self-explanatory, for now I am putting my own favorite theme, it uses the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palette, specifically macchiato is my favorite, but you can use whatever!

## Installation

Simply, copy the file to your config folder (typically ~/.config/TabAUR) and rename it to theme.toml, it should be plug and play, and you can test your colors using `taur -t` !
