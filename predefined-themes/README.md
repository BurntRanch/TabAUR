# Predefined Themes for TabAUR

TabAUR was designed to support as much customizability as you wish! You can use themes, configure some parts of how it behaves, etc.

This is a directory containing themes that you can setup in no time!

## Themes

File names should be self-explanatory, for now I am putting my own favorite theme, it uses the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palette, specifically macchiato is my favorite, but you can use whatever!

Open a Pull Request for introducing your own color palette and share it with the community if you want.

## Installation

Simple, copy the file to your config folder (typically `~/.config/TabAUR`) and rename it to theme.toml, it should be plug and play. You can test your colors using `taur -t`

If you wanna preview some colors without having to moving and renaming it, you can download the theme flavour and just test it with 

`taur -t --theme file.toml`

simple as that
