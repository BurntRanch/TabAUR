# Predefined Themes for TabAUR

TabAUR was designed to support as much customizability as you wish! You can use themes, configure some parts of how it behaves, etc.

This is a directory containing themes that you can setup in no time!

## Themes

File names should be self-explanatory.
Open a Pull Request for introducing your own color palette and share it with the community if you want.

## Test before installation
If you want to preview some colors without having to moving and renaming it, you can download the theme flavour and just test it with `taur -t --theme /path/to/file.toml`

As simple as that!

## Installation

Simple, copy the file to your config folder (typically `~/.config/TabAUR`) and rename it to theme.toml, it should be plug and play. You can test your colors using `taur -t`
